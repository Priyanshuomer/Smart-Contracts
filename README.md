# Smart Contracts

This repository contains all the smart contracts developed by me using Solidity. It includes various decentralized applications (dApps), experimental contracts, and reusable modules. The goal is to centralize and organize all smart contract work in one place for easy access, learning, and reuse.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder typically represents a specific project or module, and may include:
- `.sol` files (smart contract source code)
- Deployment and test scripts (e.g., using Foundry or Hardhat)
- Supporting frontend integration notes
- Additional utility libraries or interfaces

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks
Some of the tools and frameworks used across contracts:
- **Solidity** (main programming language)
- **Foundry** / **Hardhat** (testing & development)
- **Ethers.js** / **Web3.js** (for frontend interaction)
- **OpenZeppelin** (for standard contracts like ERC-20, ERC-721)

## 🚀 Purpose
- Practice and learning
- Reusability across projects
- Building a library of audited and reliable contracts

## 📌 Notes
- Most contracts are tested locally (on Hardhat or Anvil).
- Contracts may be deployed on testnets like Sepolia or Mumbai.
- Read comments within each contract for details on logic and usage.
